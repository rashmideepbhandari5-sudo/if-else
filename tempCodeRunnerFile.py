Write a Python program that implements a simple user registration and
# login system with the following requirements: Create a global dictionary called users_db to
# store user information. Implement a register_user(username, password, email) function that:  Checks 
# if the username already exists and returns ‘Username already exists’ if it does  Stores the 
# user's password and email in the database  Returns a success message in the format: Registration'
# ' successful for {username} Implement a login_user(username, password) function that:  Returns ‘User not '
# ''
# found’ if the username doesn't exist  Returns ‘Incorrect password’ if the password is wrong  Returns ‘Welcome back, {username}’ if
# login is successful Test the program by registering three 
# users:  ram with password ‘ram123’ and email ‘ram@email.com’  shyam with password ‘shyam456’ and email ‘shyam@email.com’  hari with password ‘hari231’ and email ‘hari@email.com’
